                Workers at Meta have reportedly been sacked for abusing the tech firm's meal voucher system, such as using it to buy toothpaste and washing powder.
                Other breaches of the policy included sharing the vouchers with others or going over budget, according to people who said they work at Meta.

                There are differing accounts over how much warning, if any, the owner of Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp gave the workers before firing them.
                Separately, the company has reportedly cut jobs across the business. Meta has been contacted for comment.
